		<h2>Who I am</h2>
			<p>My name is Shawn R. Rich, welcome to my version 1.0 of my portfolio! Before we begin, I believe a little bit of information about me is in order.</p> 
			<p>I am a dedicated and passionate web design student currently enrolled in Coursera.org's IT Support Professional and Web Design for Everyone courses. Born in Columbus, Ohio, in September 1988, I was adopted at 18 months old by a loving family in Northwest Florida. This is where I grew up, completed my primary education, and embarked on my professional journey.</p>
			<p>In 2012, I moved 30 miles east to a larger town, where I married my wonderful wife. Together, we have three childrenâ€”two grown adults and one still in elementary school. As a firm believer in Christ Jesus and the Christian faith, I feel truly blessed, and could not have achieved any of this without His help.</p>
			<p>My professional background includes eight years of experience in law enforcement, one year of service in the United States Army before being honorably medically discharged (non-combat related), and various roles in retail, stocking, and warehousing. These diverse experiences have shaped my strong work ethic and adaptability.</p>
			<p>In my free time, I enjoy playing video games, participating in Dungeons and Dragons, and continuously learning about computers and coding. My future aspirations include furthering my education in UX/UI design and data analysis to expand my skillset in the tech industry.</p>
			<p>As I move forward, I am excited to leverage my extensive background and newly acquired skills to pursue a career in web development. My goal is to work with a company where I can help design and refine websites and applications to be more user-friendly and intuitive. I am committed to continuous learning and professional growth, and I look forward to contributing to a dynamic and forward-thinking organization.</p>
